# Fast-Forwardable SSD

Fast-Forwardable SSD is a machine learning-based SSD aging framework that generates representative future wear-out states. We build FF-SSD with the following quality attributes: (1) accuracy by generating realistic distributions that match up to 99% of the full simulation results, (2) efficiency by accelerating the simulation by 2Ã— to reach a desired aged state, and (3) modularity by building the prediction module that can be integrated across multiple platforms (FTLSim, Amber, and FEMU).


FF-SSD has been [published in HotStorage 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3538643.3539757).
